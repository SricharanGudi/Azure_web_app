## Selecting Subscription and Resource Group

When creating a web app in Azure, you need to specify a subscription and a resource group to manage your resources effectively. Here's how you can do it:

1. **Choose a Subscription**:
   - In the "Project Details" section of the Azure portal, locate the "Subscription" dropdown menu.
   - Click on the dropdown to view a list of available subscriptions.
   - Select the subscription you want to use for deploying your web app. This is where you'll manage the resources and costs associated with your app.

2. **Select or Create a Resource Group**:
   - Below the "Subscription" dropdown, find the "Resource Group" dropdown menu.
   - Click on the dropdown to see a list of existing resource groups within your selected subscription.
   - Choose an existing resource group where you want to place your web app, or select "Create new" to create a new resource group specifically for your web app.
   - If you opt to create a new resource group, you'll need to provide a unique name for it. This acts like a folder to organize and manage all the resources related to your web app.

By following these steps, you ensure that your web app is properly organized within your Azure environment, making it easier to manage and maintain.

## Configuring Instance Details for a Web App

When setting up a new web app in Azure, you'll need to configure the instance details. This includes specifying the name, publish method, and runtime stack. Here's how to do it:

1. **Set the Web App Name**:
   - Enter a unique name for your web app in the "Name" field.
   - Azure will automatically generate a default hostname based on your app name.

2. **Choose the Publish Method**:
   - Select either "Code" or "Container" depending on how you plan to deploy your application.
   - "Code" is suitable for deploying applications directly from your source code.
   - "Container" is used for deploying containerized applications.

3. **Select the Runtime Stack**:
   - Choose the appropriate runtime stack from the dropdown menu.
   - This selection determines the language and framework your application will run on, such as .NET, Node.js, Python, etc.

By configuring these settings, you ensure that your web app is set up correctly to meet your development and deployment needs.

## Setting Up Web App Configuration

To properly configure your web app in Azure, you need to select an operating system and a region:

1. **Choose Operating System**:
   - Select between Linux or Windows as the operating system for your web app.
   - This choice affects the environment in which your app will run.

2. **Select Region**:
   - Choose the region closest to your target audience to minimize latency.
   - The selected region in the example is "Canada Central".

Note: If you don't see your App Service Plan, consider trying a different region or checking your App Service Environment settings.

## Configuring Zone Redundancy

Zone redundancy provides high availability for your Azure App Service plan by deploying it across multiple zones within a region:

1. **Enable Zone Redundancy**:
   - When enabled, your App Service plan and the apps within it will be zone redundant.
   - The minimum App Service plan instance count will be two to ensure redundancy.

2. **Disable Zone Redundancy**:
   - When disabled, your App Service plan and the apps within it will not be zone redundant.
   - The minimum App Service plan instance count will be one.

**Note**: Enabling zone redundancy ensures high availability but may increase costs due to the minimum instance count requirement.
